## Runing Postgres with Docker Compose

If you have access to a server and prefer to host your own PostgreSQL instance, Docker Compose offers a simple way to deploy and manage PostgreSQL containers. Below is an example of how to set up PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.

### Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: penx
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: penx
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### Running the Container

To start your PostgreSQL container, navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Accessing Your Database

Once your container is running, you can connect to your PostgreSQL instance using a connection string (referred to as DATABASE_URL). The format will look like this:

```base
postgresql://user:penx@<your-server-ip>:5432/penx

```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with the IP address of your server.
