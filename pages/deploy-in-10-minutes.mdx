# Deploy in 10 mimutes

Enjoy your PenX in **10 minutes**!

**You can deploy PenX in various ways, such as:**

- [Deploy to Vercel](/deployment/vercel)
- [Deploy to Fly.io](deployment/flyio)
- [Deploy with Docker ](/deployment/docker)
- [Deploy with Docker Compose](/deployment/docker-compose)

Here is the guide for deploying to Vercel:

<Steps>

{<h3>Click Deploy Button</h3>}

👇 Start your deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpenx-lab%2Fpenx&env=DATABASE_URL&envDescription=Your+Personal+Database+Url&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.penx.io%2Fguides%2Fenvironment-variables%23database_url&project-name=my-penx-blog&repository-name=my-penx-blog&fork=true)

{<h3>Create Git Repository</h3>}

After accessing Vercel's deployment page, you'll be prompted to select a Git repository:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your Vercel account is not yet linked to GitHub, you will be redirected to
  complete the linking process.
</Callout>

Once linking is complete, click the **Create** button:

{<h3>Configure Project</h3>}

Now, configure the necessary parameters to run the service.

You'll need a PostgreSQL connection URL, which looks like this:

```text
postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database_name?sslmode=require
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't have a URL yet, refer to this [guide](/get-a-database) to get a
  PostgreSQL database.
</Callout>

Enter the details in the designated fields as shown below, then click **Deploy** to proceed:

<Callout type="info">TreeId is your personal "key" to the Web3 world.</Callout>

To create your TreeId, visit [penx.io](https://www.penx.io/create-space) and fill out the application form:

Once created, your TreeId will be displayed below:
