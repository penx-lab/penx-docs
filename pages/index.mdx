## Features

### Tokenomics for blogs

Each blog has its own unique token, adhering to the ERC20 standard. Anyone can exchange and hold these tokens using ETH. Tokens can be used for payments such as subscriptions and advertising fees.

Based on the Bonding Curve economic model, as more people support the blog, the token's value increases, strengthening the bond between bloggers and readers and forming a community of shared interests. Tokens are also used for revenue distribution; blog earnings are distributed to beneficiaries according to their share proportions.



### Web3 subscription

Plantree offers a secure and flexible Web3 subscription system designed to enhance user experience and build trust.

- **Variety of Subscription Plans**: Bloggers can customize subscription options to meet their audience's needs.
- **Effortless Token Payments**: Users can easily subscribe using tokens, fully integrated with the platform.
