# Docker Compose

This document provides a guide for deploying PenX with Docker Compose.

## Create docker-compose.yml

To deploy PenX with docker compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  penx-self-hosted:
    image: penxio/penx:latest
    container_name: penx-self-hosted
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL={{postgresql_database_url}}
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't have a URL yet, refer to this [guide](/get-a-database) to get a
  PostgreSQL database.
</Callout>

## Start the containers

Now, execute `docker-compose up -d` to start PenX service.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Upgrading

When a new version of PenX is released, the application can be upgraded with the following commands, run in the directory with the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```
